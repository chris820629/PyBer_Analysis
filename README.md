# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
 - This study serves the purpose of finding the trend of total fare within the 4 months timeframe in 2019. There are three trendlines indicating the fares vary across different types of cities
## Results:
 - Urban total fare is the highest among other types of city.
 - There seems to be uptick of fare close to end of March timeframe
 - Driver count variance is the highest in the urban citie. 
 - The mean of driver count in urban cities is roughly 7 times more than the rural cities
 - The ride fare data shows that each ride fare is the highest in the rural cities but not significantly higher than other types of cities

**Correlation Between Average Fare vs. Total Number of Rides vs. Drive Count Per City vs. City Type**


## Summary:
- Rural cities seem to require effort to increase number of rides, probably by reducing the fare since rural ride fare shows the highest comparing to urban and suburban
- Suburban cities seem to be 30% of the revenue, it is critical to focus on the needs of suburban rides to reduce solely relying on urban ride revenue
- Urban cities already has the highest revenue among others but may need some more improvement in Januarury timeframe being the lowest total fare comparing to other months in the first quarter
